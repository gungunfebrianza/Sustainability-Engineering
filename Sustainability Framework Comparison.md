# GRI & SASB

| **Aspect**               | **GRI**                                                      | **SASB**                                                     |
| ------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Focus**        | **Broad sustainability impact** (environmental, social, economic) on stakeholders, society, and the planet. | **Financial materiality** of sustainability issues for enterprise value and investor decision-making. |
| **Materiality Lens**     | **Double materiality**:<br>1. Impact materiality (company's effect on society/environment).<br>2. Financial materiality (sustainability risks/opportunities affecting finances). | **Single materiality**:<br>Focuses solely on sustainability factors likely to impact a company's **financial performance** or valuation. |
| **Framework Structure**  | **Universal Standards** (apply to all organizations) + **Topic-Specific Standards** (e.g., GHG emissions, labor practices). | **77 Industry-Specific Standards** (e.g., for oil/gas, healthcare, tech), each with unique disclosure topics/metrics. |
| **Target Audience**      | **All stakeholders**:<br>Investors, employees, NGOs, communities, regulators. | **Investors and capital markets**:<br>Designed for use in financial filings (e.g., SEC 10-K). |
| **Reporting Format**     | **Standalone sustainability reports** (often >100 pages), flexible structure. | **Concise disclosures** (<10 pages) integrated into **financial filings** (e.g., MD&A section). |
| **Industry Approach**    | **Cross-sector principles** with sector guidance (optional). Metrics are broadly applicable. | **Mandatory industry specificity**:<br>Disclosure topics/metrics vary materially by industry. |
| **Global Applicability** | **Global standards**, widely adopted in 100+ countries. Focus on UN SDGs alignment. | **Primarily U.S.-centric**, designed for SEC filings but expanding globally. |

**Key Distinctions:**

- **Scope**: GRI prioritizes **stakeholder impact**; SASB prioritizes **investor relevance**.  
- **Depth vs. Precision**: GRI encourages comprehensive reporting; SASB emphasizes concise, financially material data.  
- **Compatibility**: Many organizations use **both** (GRI for broad impact, SASB for investor-focused materiality).

# GRI & TCFD

| **Taxonomy Aspect**           | **GRI Taxonomy**                                             | **TCFD Taxonomy**                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Scope**             | Broad ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) impacts        | Climate-related financial risks/opportunities                |
| **Core Structure**            | **3 Universal Standards** + **Topic-Specific Standards** grouped into:<br>• **100 Series** (Economic)<br>• **200 Series** (Environmental)<br>• **300 Series** (Social) | **4 Pillars**:<br>1. Governance<br>2. Strategy<br>3. Risk Management<br>4. Metrics & Targets |
| **Key Components**            | • **GRI 101**: Foundation<br>• **GRI 102**: General Disclosures<br>• **GRI 103**: Management Approach<br>• **Topic Standards** (e.g., GRI 201: Economic, GRI 305: Emissions) | • **11 Recommended Disclosures**<br>• Focus on forward-looking, scenario-based analysis |
| **Materiality Focus**         | **Impact Materiality**: Effects on economy, environment, people | **Financial Materiality**: Climate risks/opportunities affecting financial performance |
| **Target Audience**           | All stakeholders (investors, NGOs, communities, employees)   | Primarily investors and financial institutions               |
| **Climate-Specific Guidance** | Embedded in **GRI 200 Series** (e.g., GRI 305: Emissions)    | **Central focus** across all 4 pillars (e.g., transition/physical risks) |
| **Timeframe Emphasis**        | Retrospective (past performance) + Current initiatives       | Forward-looking (future risks, resilience under scenarios)   |
| **Adoption & Flexibility**    | Modular; organizations select relevant topics                | Prescriptive; aligned with financial filings                 |

**Key Differences Explained:**

1. **Scope**:  
   - **GRI**: Covers **all ESG themes** (e.g., labor practices, biodiversity, anti-corruption).  
   - **TCFD**: **Exclusively climate-focused**, linking climate to financial stability.  

2. **Structure**:  
   - **GRI**: Hierarchical standards organized by topic (e.g., "GRI 303: Water" under Environment).  
   - **TCFD**: Non-hierarchical pillars centered on **decision-useful financial disclosures**.  

3. **Materiality**:  
   - **GRI**: Prioritizes topics based on **impacts on sustainable development**.  
   - **TCFD**: Prioritizes based on **financial materiality** (e.g., stranded assets, transition costs).  

4. **Climate Integration**:  
   - **GRI**: Climate is **one environmental topic** among many (GRI 305).  
   - **TCFD**: Climate is the **core lens** for strategy, governance, and risk analysis.  

5. **Reporting Perspective**:  
   - **GRI**: Documents **past/current performance** and policies.  
   - **TCFD**: Emphasizes **future resilience** (e.g., 2°C scenario analysis).  

**Complementary Use:**

Many organizations use **GRI for comprehensive ESG reporting** and **TCFD for deep climate-risk disclosure**, aligning with frameworks like the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

# GRI & CDP

| **Feature**              | **GRI (Global Reporting Initiative)**                        | **CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project)**                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Scope**        | **Comprehensive ESG:**<br>Economic, Environmental, and Social impacts. | **Environmental Focus:**<br>Climate change, water security, forests. |
| **Taxonomy Structure**   | **Modular Standards:**<br>Organized by topics (e.g., GRI 300 for Environment, GRI 400 for Social). | **Questionnaire-Based:**<br>Annual questionnaires for Climate, Water, and Forests. |
| **Core Categories**      | 1. **Economic** (e.g., financial performance, anti-corruption).<br>2. **Environmental** (e.g., emissions, water, biodiversity).<br>3. **Social** (e.g., labor practices, human rights). | 1. **Climate Change** (e.g., emissions, risk management, targets).<br>2. **Water Security** (e.g., usage, stewardship, risks).<br>3. **Forests** (e.g., deforestation, supply chain impacts). |
| **Materiality Approach** | **Double Materiality:**<br>Impacts of the organization on society/environment + financial implications. | **Financial Materiality:**<br>Focuses on environmental risks/opportunities affecting financial performance. |
| **Reporting Output**     | Standalone sustainability reports.                           | Disclosure platform for investors (scored annually).         |
| **Stakeholder Focus**    | Broad: Investors, regulators, communities, NGOs.             | Targeted: Institutional investors and purchasers.            |
| **Geographic Reach**     | Global; adopted by 100+ countries.                           | Global; 23,000+ companies disclosed in 2024.                 |

**Key Differences Summarized:**  

- **GRI** provides a **holistic ESG framework** for broad stakeholder transparency.  
- **CDP** drills into **environmental metrics** with investor-driven disclosure demands.  
- **Integration:** Many companies use GRI for comprehensive reporting and CDP for deep environmental disclosure.
