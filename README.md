# ESG & its raison d'être

it's about capitalism evolving to account for externalities that financial statements ignore. Like how a factory's emissions affect society long-term, or how employee treatment impacts innovation

ESG demands that businesses prove they're not just profit machines but responsible stakeholders. 

ESG reporting has become essential for modern businesses due to **regulatory pressure, investor demands, risk management, competitive advantage, and societal expectations**.

## **Investor & Stakeholder Demand**

- **Capital Access**: Over $30 trillion is invested globally in ESG-focused funds (GSIA). Investors use ESG reports to screen investments, driving capital toward sustainable companies.
- **Transparency**: Shareholders demand data on long-term risks (e.g., climate impact, labor practices) beyond financials.

ESG data scarcity creates valuation discounts. 

Stems from the simple principle that a lack of data creates uncertainty, and uncertainty increases perceived risk. 

This "ESG data scarcity" is not merely a complete absence of information. It often manifests as data that is inconsistent, incomparable, unverified, and not standardized. 

ESG reporting shifts business from **profit-only** to **purpose-driven resilience**. 

#### **I. How ESG Reporting Facilitates Capital Access**

##### **Investor Screening & Mandates**

- **ESG Integration**: 85% of institutional investors use ESG data (PwC). Funds with >$120T AUM (UN PRI signatories) *require* ESG disclosures for investment eligibility.

  - These organizations are among those requiring ESG disclosures for investment eligibility 
    - **BlackRock** – ~$10 trillion AUM
    - **Vanguard** – ~$8 trillion AUM
  - If you're seeking investment from **UN PRI signatories**, especially large institutional investors:
    - **Prepare ESG disclosures** aligned with international frameworks like:
      - **TCFD** (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures)
      - **SASB** (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)
      - **GRI** (Global Reporting Initiative)
      - **ISSB** (International Sustainability Standards Board)
    - **Disclose:**
      - **Carbon emissions**
      - **Governance structure**
      - **Sustainability goals and KPIs**
      - **Social impact (labor, community, DEI, etc.)**
      - **Risk management processes**
    - **Demonstrate ESG integration** into your business model. Show how ESG is embedded in your **strategy, supply chain, R&D, and risk mitigation**. 
    - **Quantify impact** where possible (carbon savings, resource efficiency, social outcomes, etc.). Highlight measurable positive outcomes.
    - Be ready for **due diligence**: Investors may request third-party assurance or alignment with **ratings providers** (e.g., MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics).

- **Exclusionary Filters**: Companies failing ESG thresholds (e.g., high emissions, poor governance) are excluded from ESG funds, ETFs, and pension portfolios.

##### **Lower Cost of Capital**

- **Debt Markets**: Firms with strong ESG scores secure loans at lower interest rates ("greenium"). *Example*: Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) tie coupon rates to ESG targets (e.g., Ørsted’s 0.25% discount for hitting renewables goals).

##### **Specialized Capital Vehicles**

- Access to green bonds, social impact bonds, and sustainability-linked loans, which grew to **$1.1T issued in 2023** (BloombergNEF).

##### **Risk Mitigation = Investor Confidence**

Transparent reporting on climate exposure (TCFD), labor practices, or cyber governance reduces "unknown risks," lowering investor discount rates.

##### **Investors**

- **Materiality-Driven Returns**: 90% of S&P 500 studies show robust ESG practices correlate with lower volatility and higher ROE (NYU Stern).
- **Fiduciary Duty**: Legal obligations (e.g., EU SFDR) require assessing ESG risks as part of "prudent investing."
- **Portfolio Resilience**: ESG metrics predict long-term viability (e.g., water stress affecting agribusinesses, regulatory fines for governance failures).

##### **Lenders & Banks**

- **Credit Risk**: ESG weaknesses (e.g., fossil fuel reliance, poor data security) increase default probability.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Basel III and EU banking standards incorporate ESG into stress tests.

##### **Other Stakeholders**

- **Employees**: 65% consider ESG performance before joining a firm (IBM).
- **Customers**: 73% boycott brands with poor ESG practices (Accenture).
- **Regulators**: Avoid penalties under CSRD, SEC climate rules, etc.

...

## **Regulatory Compliance**

- **Mandatory Frameworks**: Laws like the EU’s CSRD (2024), the UK’s SDR, and the SEC’s proposed climate rules require ESG disclosure.
- **Avoid Penalties**: Non-compliance risks fines, legal action, and reputational damage.



## **Risk Mitigation**

- **Operational Risks**: Track resource scarcity (e.g., water), supply chain ethics, or climate vulnerabilities.
- **Reputational Risks**: Proactively address issues like emissions scandals or labor violations before they escalate.



## **Competitive Advantage**

- **Talent Attraction**: 83% of employees prefer working for sustainable companies (Deloitte).
- **Customer Trust**: 66% of global consumers pay more for sustainable brands (McKinsey).
- **Innovation**: ESG metrics reveal efficiency gaps (e.g., energy waste), spurring cost-saving innovations.



## **Long-Term Value Creation**

- **Performance Link**: Companies with strong ESG practices show 25% higher stock performance (MSCI).
- **Resilience**: Sustainable operations adapt better to climate disruptions, regulatory shifts, and social changes.



## **Societal & Ethical Accountability**

- **Stakeholder Capitalism**: Businesses face pressure to address inequality, climate justice, and governance ethics.
- **SDG Alignment**: Reports show progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., clean energy, gender equality).



## Key ESG Reporting Frameworks:

- **GRI**: Global standard for impact disclosure.
- **SASB**: Industry-specific financial materiality.
- **TCFD**: Climate-related financial risks.
- **ISSB**: Consolidating standards for global consistency.



## Challenges:

- **Greenwashing**: Vague claims without data erode trust. Robust reporting requires audited metrics.
- **Complexity**: Varying standards create confusion. Harmonization efforts (e.g., ISSB) aim to simplify.
