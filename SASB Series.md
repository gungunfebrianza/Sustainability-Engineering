# SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) Series - Comprehensive Analysis

## Historical Context and Development

**Foundation and Evolution** SASB was established in 2011 as an independent nonprofit organization to develop sustainability accounting standards for public companies. The organization was founded on the principle that sustainability information should be material, comparable, and decision-useful for investors. In 2021, SASB merged with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) to form the Value Reporting Foundation, which subsequently integrated into the IFRS Foundation in 2022.

**Market-Driven Approach** Unlike other sustainability frameworks, SASB emerged from capital markets demand for standardized, financially material sustainability information. This investor-centric genesis fundamentally shaped its methodology and continues to influence its application.
