# Chapter 1: Introduction to Factor Emissions

## 1.1 What are Factor Emissions?

Factor emissions represent the quantitative relationship between an activity and the resulting environmental emissions. They are mathematical coefficients that convert human activities into quantities of pollutants or greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.

### 1.1.1 Basic Definition

Factor emissions are expressed as:

- The mass of a pollutant emitted
- Per unit of activity or source material
- Under specific operating conditions

For example: kg CO₂ per liter of fuel burned, or g NOx per kilometer driven.

### 1.1.2 Mathematical Expression

The basic formula for calculating emissions using emission factors is:

```
E = A × EF × (1 - ER/100)

Where:
E = Emissions
A = Activity rate
EF = Emission factor
ER = Overall emission reduction efficiency (%)
```

# Chapter 2: Mathematical Prerequisites

## 2.1 Units and Conversions

### 2.1.1 SI Units in Emissions Calculations

The International System of Units (SI) forms the foundation for emissions calculations. Key base units include:

- Mass (kg): Used for quantifying emissions amounts
- Time (s): For rate calculations
- Temperature (K): Critical for gas calculations
- Amount of substance (mol): For chemical calculations
- Volume (m³): For gas measurements

Derived units important for emissions include:

- Concentration: kg/m³, ppm, mg/L
- Flow rates: m³/s, kg/s
- Emission rates: kg/hr, tonnes/year
- Energy: Joules (J), kilowatt-hours (kWh)

### 2.1.2 Common Conversion Factors

Essential conversion relationships:

Temperature conversions:

- °C to K: T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15
- °F to °C: T(°C) = (T(°F) - 32) × 5/9

Mass conversions:

- 1 metric tonne = 1000 kg
- 1 pound = 0.4536 kg
- 1 short ton = 907.185 kg

Volume conversions:

- 1 m³ = 1000 L
- 1 ft³ = 0.02832 m³
- 1 US gallon = 0.003785 m³

Concentration conversions:

- ppm to mg/m³: C(mg/m³) = (C(ppm) × M × P) / (R × T) where: M = molecular weight (g/mol) P = pressure (atm) R = gas constant (0.08206 L⋅atm/mol⋅K) T = temperature (K)

### 2.1.3 Dimensional Analysis

Systematic approach to unit conversion and verification:

1. Method of unit cancellation: Example: Converting g/s to kg/hr
   - (g/s) × (1 kg/1000 g) × (3600 s/1 hr) = kg/hr
2. Dimensional homogeneity:
   - All terms in equations must have consistent dimensions
   - Verification method for equation correctness

## 2.2 Basic Statistical Concepts

### 2.2.1 Descriptive Statistics

Central Tendency Measures:

- Arithmetic mean: x̄ = (∑xᵢ)/n
- Weighted mean: x̄ₗ = (∑wᵢxᵢ)/(∑wᵢ)

# Chapter 3: Emission Factor Calculations

## 3.1 Basic Emission Factor Equations

### 3.1.1 Fundamental Emission Calculation Formula

Where:

- E = Emissions
- A = Activity rate or activity data
- EF = Emission factor
